BananaForge is a web application demonstrating a pipeline for converting text prompts into 3D-printable models. It uses AI to generate consistent front and back views of a subject, which is the first step in creating a digital 3D model.

## Demo for Kaggle "Nana Banana" Competition

This project serves as a demonstration for the Kaggle competition: **[Nano Banana Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/banana)**.

It showcases a practical application of generating consistent, paired images ("Nana Banana") which are essential for 2D-to-3D conversion algorithms.

## Project Status

This is a private project built by a 3D printing enthusiast. Development and feature additions will continue as time permits. It is currently a work in progress.
